# Overall Website Concept

Create a modern, professional website for an IT services company named **SolanaLink**. The design should be clean, with a clear focus on corporate trust and technological expertise. Use a color palette that includes shades of blue, gray, and white. The layout should be easy to navigate, with distinct sections for each of their services: Cloud Computing, E-commerce, Web Solutions, Blockchain, and Compliance.

## Section-Specific Prompts

### Header
Design a hero section for SolanaLink with a bold headline, "End-to-end services across cloud, e-commerce, web, blockchain, and compliance." Include a prominent call-to-action button, "Contact Us".

### Services Section
Create a services page layout with five distinct sections. Each section should have a clear icon for its topic (e.g., a cloud for Cloud Computing, a shopping cart for E-commerce, a network icon for Web, a blockchain node for Blockchain, and a shield for Compliance). Use bullet points to list the sub-services under each heading.

### Compliance Section
Design a section to highlight SolanaLink's new Compliance & Investigations services. The design should convey security and authority. Use a layout that presents the key services—AML/KYT Screening, Business KYC, and Blockchain Investigations—with concise descriptions.

### Contact Section
Create a contact section with a professional headshot of Tony and clear links to his social media profiles on LINE, Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub.

## Design Recommendations

To make your website visually compelling and professional, consider these recommendations:

- **Visuals**: Incorporate subtle background animations or high-quality, professional images related to technology and security.

- **Icons**: Use a consistent set of icons for each service category to improve visual recognition. For example, a cloud for "Cloud Computing" and a padlock for "Security".

- **Hierarchy**: Use different font sizes and weights to create a clear visual hierarchy. The main service titles should be larger and bolder than the sub-services.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the design is fully responsive and looks good on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
